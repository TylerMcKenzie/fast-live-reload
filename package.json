  "readme": "# fast-live-reload\nThe swiss army knife of live reloading. Continuously develop without refreshing your browser.\nA live reload that works with all the possible browsers (ie8+)\nwithout external dependencies (like jQuery), can serve local\nfiles, and integrate with whatever development flow you're having,\nincluding other watcher tools or build steps (in the **Complete Help and Example**\nyou can see `typescript` and `compass` integration, using their native\nwatchers for optimal development speed, side by side with multiple folders\nthat trigger different actions on change).\nReloading works also without altering the code of your web site.\nWatch a [presentation for v1.1.0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXN0rTAuMO4).\nIt's only 10 minutes long, and you get to see fast-live-reload in action. Even on IE.\n## Why\nI wanted a simple tool where I can develop and test all kinds of web applications with\nease on all browsers, even on remote machines (see for example\n[https://www.modern.ie/en-us]() ).\nThis tool is specifically designed for that.\n## Example\n```\n$ fast-live-reload\n1. Will notify the changes for clients on port 9001\n2. and will serve the content from . on port 9000\n3. and will monitor and execute when files change in subfolders:\n   a: .    \n```\nAll of the above parameters can be changed.\nYou can open in a browser any HTML page via the `http://localhost:9000/`, edit it, and\nsee the page reloading live.\nFor all the resources that have the mimetype as text/html, the live reload client script will\nbe automatically injected before the end of the body tag (the auto injection can be disabled\nvia `-no-inject`).\nLive reloading is possible without having to add any client script\n_even for static resources_, by navigating to the /fast-live-reload/ URL,\nin this case it would be:\n```\nhttp://localhost:9000/fast-live-reload/\n```\n## Complete Help and Example\n```\n$ fast-live-reload -h\nfast-live-reload: The swiss army knife of live reloading.\nMonitors multiple folders for changes, notifies connected clients, executes programs, serves local content, proxies sites, iframe reloads existing pages...\nUsage: fast-live-reload [options]\nOptions:\n    --interval          Poll every how many milliseconds.  [100]\n    -s, --serve         Folder or site (via IFrame) to serve.\n    -e, --execute       Execute the given commands on change.\n    -ep, -pe, --parallel-execute\n                        Run processes as long as fast-live-reload runs.\n    -p, --port          Port to listen to.  [9001]\n    -sp, --serve-port   Port to serve files to.  [9000]\n    -ns, --no-serve     Don't serve any local folder or site.\n    -nc, --no-clients   Don't start the client change server.\n    -ni, --no-inject    Don't inject client code.\n    -nn, --no-notify    Don't notify clients.\n    -n, --dry-run       Show what will be done. Don't execute.\n    --add-path          Paths to monitor for changes. Defaults to serve folder.\nExample:\nfast-live-reload -s /target/ \\\n    -ep \"tsc --watch --rootDir src/ts --outDir out/js --sourceMap src/ts/*.ts\"\\\n    -ep \"compass watch\"\\\n    src/js -e \"grunt concat sync\"\\\n    src/html src/css -e \"grunt sync\"\n1. Will notify the changes for clients on port 9001\n2. and will serve the content from /target/ on port 9000\n3. and will run on startup, and then kill on shutdown:\n   a: tsc --watch --rootDir src/ts --outDir out/js --sourceMap src/ts/*.ts\n   b: compass watch\n4. and will monitor and execute when files change in subfolders:\n   a: src/js   -> grunt concat sync\n   b: src/html -> grunt sync\n      src/css\n```\n### Run only programs when files change \nWe disable both serving or proxying files (`-ns`) and the client reload \nserver (`-nc`).\n```\n$ fast-live-reload -ns -nc graph-data \\\n    -e \"groovy generate-graph-data.groovy\" \\\n    -e \"dot -Tpng -ocustom-graph.png custom.graph\"\n1. Will monitor and execute when files change in subfolders:\n   a: graph-data -> groovy generate-graph-data.groovy (no refresh)\n                    dot -Tpng -ocustom-graph.png custom.graph\n```\n## Remote Locations\nRemote locations are proxied, and the reloader will allow to reload the\nbrowser even if it's an external URL, when files change.\n```\n$ fast-live-reload -s http://localhost:8080/my-webapp/some-page.jsp\nWill\n1. notify the changes for clients on port 9001,\n2. serve the content from http://localhost:8080/my-webapp/some-page.jsp on port 9000,\n3. and will monitor and execute when files change in subfolders:\n   a: .\n```\nThis will proxy the localhost:8080 host on port 9000, and will allow getting\nthe /fast-live-reload/ URL into the website, where the monitoring of the site\nwill take place.\nHere are the benefits of using remote locations:\n1. In case the page would crash (e.g. 500 error), the reloader will still attempt\n    to reload it, when changes occur.\n2. Changing the page works, and when reloading, it will reload the current iframe\n    page.\n## Install\nIn order to install this run:\n```sh\nnpm install -g fast-live-reload\n```\n### Client JavaScript\n_You don't need to change your code if you're serving files (`-s`) without `--no-inject`, \nor using the IFrame reloader._\nIf you must use the reloader script (e.g. a site that redirects to itself due to security)\nthen fetch it with bower, and refer to it into your html pages.\n```sh\nbower install fast-live-reload\n```\nCheck the [documentation](doc/Client_Configuration.md) for full details.\n## Change Log\n* v2.2.0  2015-06-12  Automatically inject the client script in html resources. (disable with `-ni`)\n* v2.1.0  2015-06-12  Allow no client notifications for executions (`-nn`) or no client server altogether (`-ns`)\n* v2.0.0  2015-06-09  Allow parallel execution (`-pe`), multiple monitor/execution flows, dry runs (`-n`).
